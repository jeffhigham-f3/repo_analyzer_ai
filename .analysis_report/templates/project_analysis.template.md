# [PROJECT_NAME] - Comprehensive Project Analysis Report

_Generated on: [CURRENT_DATE]_  
_Analysis Period: [START_DATE] - [END_DATE]_  
_Total Development Time: [DURATION]_

## Template Placeholder System

**Important**: This template uses a numeric placeholder system where `N` represents a dynamic number that should be expanded based on actual analysis results.

**Examples of N Placeholders:**
- `[FEATURE_N]` expands to: `[FEATURE_1]`, `[FEATURE_2]`, `[FEATURE_3]`, etc.
- `[CORE_FEATURE_N]` expands to: `[CORE_FEATURE_1]`, `[CORE_FEATURE_2]`, etc.
- `[TICKET_N]` expands to: `[TICKET_1]`, `[TICKET_2]`, etc.

**How to Use:**
1. Count the actual items discovered during analysis
2. Replace `[FEATURE_N]` with `[FEATURE_1]`, `[FEATURE_2]`, etc.
3. Remove any unused placeholder rows
4. Adjust table structures to match the actual number of items
